# Keyboard_draw
Letters and numbers recognizer made with Keras, uses Emnist dataset. 
Project is under development with purpose of learning.
Other people may be interested because of:
in models dir there is a python program which unpacks emnist dataset to directories(was kindof hard to find),
also good example of flow_from_directory usage(noob level),
also working solution for labeling classes in predictions if you used flow to train(also interesting for noobs only, tho i would 
have liked finding something similar when i had the problem:D)
If you have any kind of advice you are most welcome to advice me:D
Goal of the project is to make a pc drawn letter and number recognizer and put it online, also if i get better at this itll have
dataset supervision so the user given samples that drop accuracy will be automatically thrown out and etc.
